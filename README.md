# Unscramble-the-words

The goal of this project is to unscramble words in the text file "unscramble_words.txt" and find the corresponding word in "wordlist.txt".

For instance the word "tanabm" exist in the text file "unscramble_words.txt". The corresponding word in "wordlist.txt" is batman.

My approach to solve this problem was to sort all unscramble words and all wordlist words in alphabetical order and match them.
